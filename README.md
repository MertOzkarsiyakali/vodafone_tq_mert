Firstly I would love to mention about the programming languages and its libraries, technologies which I used on this project.

I was familiar with Python but, to be honest, never worked with its Flask library before, which is used for web development projects by using Python. On this project I tried to learn, and then used this library. Also i imported the "mysql_connector" and "requests" technologies of Python to manage, store and retrieve data on different parts of the work

WebAPI, I have chosen the openweathermap.org API for my project, I have connected the API on my Python code, by using my unique API key given by openweathermap

For Database, I used MySQL, I recently found a website which creates and allows to manage a free 5MB database for its users, also shares the "host", "user", "password", and "database name" attributes to use for connection of database.

For the main page, I used HTML, the file is in templates, called "weather.html"

For testing, on my Terminal, firstly I reached the stored location of my project, then executed by using the "python app.py" command, it started to execute on my localhost:5000/  

Basically, whenever the "Fetch Data" button is being hitted, new data (New York City's recent weather conditions) will be coming from the API and represented on the screen by it's timebase.

There is some screenshot taken by me when I finished the project..
